                    "answer": "HARBOR offers three license types: Training License (use data to train AI models with no usage limits), Commercial License (use in commercial products with redistribution rights), and Exclusive License (exclusive access where competitors cannot license the same data). Each license type has different pricing and terms tailored to your use case.",
