# From Bricks to Bytes: How Your LEGO Videos Can Train AI

You've been filming your LEGO builds for years. Views are nice, but what if those videos were actually valuable?

## The Hidden Value in Your Content

Every LEGO build video you've made contains:

- **Temporal sequences** - The order things happen
- **Spatial relationships** - How parts fit together
- **Hand-object interactions** - Fine motor movements
- **Problem-solving patterns** - How you handle mistakes

AI companies pay serious money for this kind of data.

## Why LEGO Specifically?

LEGO is the perfect training ground because:

1. **Standardized parts** - Every 2x4 brick is identical worldwide
2. **Progressive complexity** - From Duplo to Technic, clear skill gradients
3. **Instructions exist** - Ground truth for verification
4. **Massive community** - Millions of potential contributors

## What Makes a Video Valuable

Not all videos are equal. High-value LEGO training data has:

| Quality Factor | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| Clear overhead view | ML models need to see the build plate |
| Good lighting | Shadows confuse part detection |
| Steady camera | Motion blur kills annotations |
| Natural speed | Too fast = missing frames |
| Audio narration | Multi-modal learning opportunity |

## How Much Can You Earn?

Compensation varies, but:

- **Basic build videos**: $5-15 per annotated minute
- **Complex MOCs**: $25-50 per video
- **Instructional content**: Premium rates for teaching

## Get Started
