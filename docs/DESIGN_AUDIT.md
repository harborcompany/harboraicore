# Design Audit Findings

## Step 1: Full Audit Results

### Landing Page (`/`)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Strong. Hero H1 works well.
- **Typography** [CRITICAL]:
    - Primary CTA "TRY AGENTWOOD" has a font size of **10px**. This is illegible and below accessibility standards (should be 14px-16px).
    - Subtext is **14px** with 60% opacity. Borderline readability.
- **Spacing**:
    - Gap between Hero and "Difference" section is ~197px. This feels excessive unless it's a specific "reveal" effect, but likely just too much whitespace.
- **Content**: No placeholders found.
